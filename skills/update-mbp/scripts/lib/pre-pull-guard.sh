# _ump_pre_pull_guard — refuse a dotty pull while a profile still symlinks a
# packaged skill into the checkout without the work-lifecycle plugin enabled
# for that profile.
#
# Why this exists: a dotty pull deletes the packaged skill directories once
# the harness cutover ships. If a profile's skills/<name> entries still link
# into that checkout and work-lifecycle isn't enabled there, the pull leaves
# the profile with neither the symlink's target nor the plugin — every
# command "succeeds" but the skill resolves nowhere. This guard runs before
# any pull so that state can never be produced by an unattended apply.
#
# Shared source: embedded into the remote script apply-updates.sh generates,
# so it runs on the target host, before the pull. Sourcing this file only
# defines the function below — nothing executes on source.
#
# The four skills below have no installed-plugin replacement yet and stay
# declared and linked into dotty until each is given a plugin or thin-layer
# home; the guard does not fire for them.
